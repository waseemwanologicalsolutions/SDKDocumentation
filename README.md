# Intempt iOS SDK

## Requirements <a name="Requirements"></a>
- iOS 12.0+
- Minimum Xcode 10.0


## Getting Started <a name="GettingStarted"></a>

### Integration: <a name="Integration"></a>
1. At first download sdk from https://github.com/intempt/ios-sdk.git). Then open the folder frameworks. There are three sdks in  this folder **'device' 'simulator'** and **'universal'**. 
<img width="573" alt="1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93919087/144225604-a6e8ca7e-9d0f-4210-ac21-c0d2bd8ac06f.png">

- **Simulator** will run only on simulators
- **Device** will run only on devices
- **Universal** will run on both simulators and devices, but for that there are two extra things need to do during integration. Given integration steps are for universal so please follow all steps inorder to run without any error.

2. Open **universal** folder and first copy `Intempt.Framework` into your project directory and then Drag & Drop `Intempt.Framework` in your iOS app.
<img width="1417" alt="2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93919087/144225626-73c69b69-cc2f-4f91-8b46-e7d832871460.png">
<img width="1244" alt="3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93919087/144225684-83c33889-52e1-4f0f-adbb-1806cbb55d44.png">

3. `Intempt.framework` must set to `Embed & Sign`, Select your project `Traget -> Build Phase` expand `Embed Framework` and press `+` add `Intempt.framework`

<img width="1384" alt="adding Intempt into Build Phase" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93919087/144842029-09e9454d-3990-4265-9086-2d8bd2b3fc97.png">

<img width="1378" alt="Screenshot 2021-12-03 at 12 04 13 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93919087/144560810-03b1c091-2060-448f-a257-8e7fb0ae6527.png">

make sure in `Target ->General->Framework, Libraries and Embded Contents` `Embed & Sign` is selected.

<img width="1243" alt="4" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93919087/144225710-c4b4c9d0-a24f-4fc6-97ae-c82834185d27.png">

4. Select your project `Target -> Build Settings` and search `Validate Workspace` Set Value to NO, if its already NO, then set to YES once and then set again to NO. This is workaround as sometimes xcode doesn't understand, so toggeling the value between YES/NO it worked.

<img width="1389" alt="Validate Workspace" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93919087/144861179-642d1a07-948a-4e12-ab21-ae84df9fb92c.png">


5. If you have added `intempt.framework` as `universal` then when submitting to app store Apple will show error of simulator architectures. To resolve this issue please select your project `Target -> Build Phase` and select `+` sign and add `New Run Script Phase`. It will add an empty runscript below, expand it and put the below script as shown in below screen shot.

```run script
# skip if we run in debug
if [ "$CONFIGURATION" == "Debug" ]; then
echo "Skip frameworks cleaning in debug version"
exit 0
fi

APP_PATH="${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/"

# This script loops through the frameworks embedded in the application and
# removes unused architectures.
find "$APP_PATH" -name '*.framework' -type d | while read -r FRAMEWORK
do
FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME=$(defaults read "$FRAMEWORK/Info.plist" CFBundleExecutable)
FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH="$FRAMEWORK/$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME"
echo "Executable is $FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"

EXTRACTED_ARCHS=()

for ARCH in $ARCHS
do
echo "Extracting $ARCH from $FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME"
lipo -extract "$ARCH" "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH" -o "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-$ARCH"
EXTRACTED_ARCHS+=("$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-$ARCH")
done

echo "Merging extracted architectures: ${ARCHS}"
lipo -o "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-merged" -create "${EXTRACTED_ARCHS[@]}"
rm "${EXTRACTED_ARCHS[@]}"

echo "Replacing original executable with thinned version"
rm "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"
mv "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-merged" "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"

done
```
<img width="1198" alt="10" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93919087/144419018-82fb85a5-6e4a-402e-90f2-c6bda30039d5.png">

If you have followed the above 5 steps then you will be able to compile without any error.

### Swift :
If Xcode 11.3 or above

Goto AppDelegate.swift file

``` swift
import Intempt
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        
        ///Your code here
        
        //Initialize Intempt SDK
        let intemptConfig = IntemptConfig(queueEnabled: true, withItemsInQueue: 7, withTimeBuffer: 15, withInitialDelay: 0.3, withInputTextCaptureDisabled: false)
        IntemptTracker.tracking(withOrgId: "Your Organization Id", withSourceId: "Your Source ID", withToken: "Your Token", withConfig: intemptConfig) { (status, result, error) in
            if(status) {
                if let dictResult = result as? [String: Any] {
                    print(dictResult)
                }
            }
            else {
                if let error = error {
                    print(error.localizedDescription)
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
```
Else you will have the `ViewController.swift` file and then paste the copied source snippet into the `viewDidLoad` function: 

``` swift
import Intempt
  override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
      
	 //Initialize Intempt SDK
        let intemptConfig = IntemptConfig(queueEnabled: true, withItemsInQueue: 7, withTimeBuffer: 15, withInitialDelay: 0.3, withInputTextCaptureDisabled: false)
        IntemptTracker.tracking(withOrgId: "Your Organization Id", withSourceId: "Your Source ID", withToken: "Your Token", withConfig: intemptConfig) { (status, result, error) in
            if(status) {
                if let dictResult = result as? [String: Any] {
                    print(dictResult)
                }
            }
            else {
                if let error = error {
                    print(error.localizedDescription)
                }
            }
        }
}
```
### Objective C :

If you are using Xcode 11.3 or above go to `AppDelegate.m` file and paste the copied source snippet like the following:

``` objectivec
@import Intempt;
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    // Your code here
    
    //initalize intempt SDK
    IntemptConfig *intemptConfig  = [[IntemptConfig alloc]initWithQueueEnabled:YES withItemsInQueue:7 withTimeBuffer:15 withInitialDelay:0.3 withInputTextCaptureDisabled:NO];
    [IntemptTracker trackingWithOrgId:@"Your Organization Id" withSourceId:@"Your Source ID" withToken:@"Your Token" withConfig:intemptConfig onCompletion:^(BOOL status, id result, NSError *error) {
        
    }];
    
    return YES;
}
```

Else you will have the `ViewController.m` file and then paste the copied source snippet like the following:

``` objectivec
@import Intempt
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    
     //initalize intempt SDK
    IntemptConfig *intemptConfig  = [[IntemptConfig alloc]initWithQueueEnabled:YES withItemsInQueue:7 withTimeBuffer:15 withInitialDelay:0.3 withInputTextCaptureDisabled:NO];
    [IntemptTracker trackingWithOrgId:@"Your Organization Id" withSourceId:@"Your Source ID" withToken:@"Your Token" withConfig:intemptConfig onCompletion:^(BOOL status, id result, NSError *error) {
        
    }];
}
```
### Get Organization ID and Source ID <a name="OrganizationIDandSourceID"></a>
To get your organization Id and source Id you need to create your account on https://app.intempt.com/ and then go to https://app.intempt.com/sources/ 
- 1 Create Organization
- 2 Create Source
- 3 Copy Source ID, Organization Id and Token in your Xcode app for IntemptSDK initialization. 

<img width="1389" alt="Source Creation" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93919087/144863636-d986410c-b87a-4ba0-b33a-d68b2c934d4c.png">


### Events Tracking <a name="EventsTracking"></a>

IntemptSDK track different type events, some of these are default and some are custom, default events are automatically started tracking when SDK is initialized and for custom events developer have to write code whereever required. Below types events are in IntemptSDK
- Application Launch Tracking (Default, automatically tracked)
- Screen Tracking (Default, automatically tracked)
- Interaction Tracking (Default, automatically tracked)
- Consent (Default, automatically tracked)
- Location (Depending on application, if user of the app has allowed location permission then country, city level location is tracked)
- Identity (Manual, Developer have to implement it)
- Custom (Developer have to create schema and implement in app)

#### Get VisitorId From Framework <a name="GetVisitorIdFromFramework"></a>

``` swift
let visitorId = IntemptClient.shared()?.getVisitorId()
```
#### Identifying Visitors <a name="IdentifyingVisitors"></a>
Provide email or phone number.

``` swift
IntemptTracker.identify("test@example.com", withProperties: nil) { (status, error) in 
	if(status) {
		//Do something
	}
}
```
#### Custom Event <a name="CustomEvent"></a>
On using this a user can create a custom event based on the need of the project and can track the event details with that custom method.
To add custom event below should be flow

- 1 Visit the Intempt Console https://app.intempt.com/sources/
- 2 Select Organization -> Source -> Schema
- 3 Drag 'Add collection' from the right panel(Schema Builder) to the exisiting collections list
- 5 Drag the 'Add field' to the added collection, add as many fields as required.
- 6 Set field type carefully e.g if the data from app is string and field type set in int then there will be error.
- 7 If you want to link the events with the visitor session then add 'sessionId' as foreign key of 'Session' collection into that collection

Every custom event schema must have `timestamp of type long` and `eventId of type string` fields, otherwise your custom event will not be saved and you will get bad request error.

**Please becarefull when renaming, Collection and Field name 
always start with small letter**

```swift 
let arrayData = [{       
                "flightId" : "1",
                "bookingDate" : "2020-05-26",
                "bookingId": "2",
                "bookingStatus" : "booked"
              }]
        IntemptTracker.track("flight-booking", withProperties: arrayData as? [Any]) { (status, result, error) in
            if(status) {
                if let dictResult = result as? [String: Any] {
                    print(dictResult)
                }
            }
            else {
                if let error = error {
                    print(error.localizedDescription)
                }
            }
        }
}             
```
Schema of above example 'flight-booking' looks like below screenshot

<img width="1391" alt="flight-Booking Collection" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93919087/144866546-27b62a61-ef6f-4830-a879-080448c9c077.png">


#### Disable Text Capture <a name="DisableTextCapture"></a>
Call this method if you want to disable capturing input texts like UItextField, UItextView. By default its `false`. Secure entries are also excluded for privacy.

```swift 
IntemptTracker.disableTextInput(true)
```

#### Disable Default Event Tracking <a name="DisableDefaultEventTracking"></a>
Call this method if you want to disable default tracking. This action is persistent, once disabled then developer must need to enable again when want to track default events again.

```swift 
IntemptClient.disableTracking()
```

#### Enable Default Event Tracking <a name="EnableDefaultEventTracking"></a>
Call this method if you had disabled tracking and want to enable again.

```swift 
IntemptClient.enableTracking()
```

#### Enable Event Logging <a name="EnableEventLogging"></a>
Call this method if you want to see the logs of all generated events, errors for debug purposes. By default logging is disabled

```swift 
IntemptClient.enableLogging()
```
#### Disable Event Logging <a name="DisableEventLogging"></a>
Call this method if you want not see any output in console.

```swift 
IntemptClient.disableLogging()
```

## Tracking iOS14 and ATTTransportSecurity framework <a name="iOS14"></a>
Intempt itself does not get IDFA and doesn't track user by default. Data is not forwarded to any external services, and is not linked with any third-party data. Also events captured are not linked to user indentity and not used for user tracking purpose. Analytic are captured to observe the user behavior, viuslations of app usage and improving user experience based on user activities in the app. So with the default configuration there is no need for adding Apple Tracking Transparency permission in info.plist and asking user consent. Also don't include Apple Tracking Transparency framework in your app. However if your app has other external integrations or you have implemented custom events which track user or share user data with other then you have to include it.

## Privacy - Location Permission <a name="Privacy"></a>
IntemptSDK itself doesn't ask user for the location permission and doesn't fetch user location. However IntemptSDK has refence to CoreLocations framework and if the app(where IntemptSDK integrated) already have obtained user consent for Location then IntemptSDK track user location of city, region, country level. As the IntemptSDK has reference to CoreLocations framework so it is required to add `Privacy - Location` in info.plist with explaining the purpose of location fetch and usage.

Go to app's Info.plist file and add the privacy keys.

| Key | Value |
| ------ | ------ |
| Privacy - Location Always Usage Description | Location used to track where you are and showing most relevant content to you.|
| Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description | Location used to track where you are and showing most relevant content to you |
| Privacy - Location Always and When In Use Usage Description | Location used to track where you are and showing most relevant content to you |

## Intempt Proximity
### ibeacon does not support Xcode iOS Simulator. You need a real device to test the ibeacon.
Install an Intempt beacon At your preferable place. Add this SDK in your existing application. Thus it will help you to know about your entry and exit range.
This sdk supports any kind of beacon that allows you to change the UUID in the vendors Beacon Manager. The UUID is a unique broadcasting number which allows Intempt to know which types of beacons to look for. You can think of it like tuning to a radio station.

Today, Intempt’s mobile SDK looks for ONE UUID by default. Use any of them with your existing beacons to enable them with Intempt.

### Key components

Intempt Proximity SDK is built on top of two key components: _

- Entry -  when you are enter a region.

- Exit -  when you are exit a region.


Go to app's Info.plist file and add the privacy keys.


| Key | Value |
| ------ | ------ |
| Privacy - Location Always Usage Description | Location used to track where you are and showing most relevant content to you|
| Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description | Location used to track where you are and showing most relevant content to you|
| Privacy - Location Always and When In Use Usage Description | Location used to track where you are and showing most relevant content to you|
| Privacy - Bluetooth Always Usage Description | This app uses Bluetooth communication to detect nearby beacons |
| Privacy - Bluetooth Peripheral Usage Description | This app uses Bluetooth communication to detect nearby beacons |




### Swift :

ViewController.swift file

``` swift
import Intempt
  override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        IntemptTracker.beacon(withOrgId: "Your Organization ID", andSourceId: "Your Source ID", andToken: "Your Token", andDeviceUUID:"Beacon device UUID")
        IntemptClient.shared()?.delegate = self
  }
```

Next implement this methods:

``` swift
/*Helps to detect the entry time , when application entered the monitoring region*/
func  didEnterRegion(_ beaconData: CLBeacon!) {
}

/*Helps to detect the exit time , when application exits the monitoring region*/
func  didExitRegion(_ beaconData: CLBeacon!) {
}
```

### Objective C :
ViewController.m file

``` objectivec
@import Intempt;
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    [IntemptTracker beaconWithOrgId:@"Your Organization ID" andSourceId:@"Your Source ID" andToken:@"Your Token" andDeviceUUID:@"Beacon device UUID"];
    IntemptClient.sharedClient.delegate = self;
}
```

Next implement this methods:

``` objectivec
/*Helps to detect the entry time , when application entered the monitoring region*/
- (void)didEnterRegion:(CLBeacon*)beaconData {
}

/*Helps to detect the exit time , when application exits the monitoring region*/
- (void)didExitRegion:(CLBeacon*)beaconData {
}
```


#### Identifying Visitors (Optional)
Provide email or phone number.

``` swift
IntemptTracker.identifyUsingBeacon("test@example.com", withProperties: nil) { (status, error) in 
	if(status) {
		//Do something
	}
}
```
Use this method when you want to identify using beacon API separately.  
##How to test beacon functionality using Beacon Android simulator?
### Installation :
* At first Download App from https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.alea.beaconsimulator&hl=en_IN

* Then open the iOS app you integrated Intempt framework.

* Next set up beacon simulator in each room.
The room you go to will get the entry and exit value of the room.

## Troubleshooting <a name="Troubleshooting"></a>
### Building for iOS, but the linked and embedded framework 'Intempt.framework' was built for iOS + iOS Simulator. <a name="Universalframework"></a>
If you have used intempt universal framework then you may face this error. To resolve this please follow below steps.

Select your project `Target -> Build Settings` and search `Validate Workspace` Set Value to NO, if its already NO, then set to YES once and then set again to NO. This is workaround as sometimes xcode doesn't understand, so toggeling the value between YES/NO it worked.

### Appstore uploading issue of invalid unsupported architectures. <a name="unsupportedarchitectures"></a>

If you have added `intempt.framework` as `universal` then when submitting to app store Apple will show error of simulator architectures. To resolve this issue please select your project `Target -> Build Phase` and select `+` sign and add `New Run Script Phase`. It will add an empty runscript below, expand it and put the below script as shown in below screen shot.
